## Exercises

## 03-1: Student Average

1.  Modify the program so that it stores and averages 8 marks.
2.  Modify the program so that it allows the user to input the number of marks they want to store.  ***Note:  You will need to declare the marks array after this input line.***
3.  Now, with an unknown number of marks in the array, you will need to modify how you calculate the average.  ***Note:  You will need to use a loop and the idea of using an accumulator that we used in grade 11 with Python.***
