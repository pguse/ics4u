# Arrays

Consider the following starter code:

```

```

When we need to store more than one value that is part of a group of values, we use an array.  This is similar to a list in Python, but different in that you must decide on the number of values when the array is originally declared.  The array called marks is declared on line 9, and can contain 3 integers.  Unlike in Python, you cannot add or delete elements to/from the array.  It will always contain three values (initially, the values are zero in this case).

Notice the use of indexes, from lines 10 to 12 that are used to store values in the array, and on line 14 to access values in an array.
