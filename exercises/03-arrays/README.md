## 03-0: Student Average

1.  Create a folder called **StudentAverageArrays**.  Create a C# program that stores and averages 8 marks in an integer array.  The marks will be input by the user.
2.  Calculate the average, by using a **for-loop**.  ***Note:  You will need to use the idea of using an accumulator that we used in grade 11 with Python.***
3.  Output both the marks ***(alll on one line)*** and the average, as shown in the example below.

```
Mark #1: 72
Mark #2: 85
Mark #3: 67
Mark #4: 78
Mark #5: 90
Mark #6: 81
Mark #7: 87
Mark #8: 75
