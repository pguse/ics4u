## 00-1 Hello World

1.  Initialize a C# Project

    * Open the command prompt *(or terminal)
    * Navigate to the folder where you'd like to creat the C# project
    * Type **dotnet new console**
    * This creates a **Program.cs** file in your folder with a simple "Hello World" program already written.
2.  When a project folder is first opened in VS Code, a notification will appear at the top of the window asking if you'd like to add the required assets to build and debug your project.  Select **Yes**.
3.  Run the **Hello World** program by typing dotnet run in the command prompt *(or terminal)*.
