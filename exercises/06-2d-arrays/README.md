# 2-Dimensional Arrays

Complete the following exercises using the starter code provided.  You should demonstrate how your functions work using this code.

## Exercises

## 03-0: Random Matrix

Create a function called **RandomMatrix(int n)** that creates a 2-dimensional array (matrix), with **n** rows and **n** columns, made up of 0's and 1's chosen randomly.  The function should return the array that gets created.

## 03-1: Find

Create a function called **Find(int[] m, int x)** that searches for a value **x** in a matrix (2d-array) **m**.  It should return the position {row, col} if it finds it, otherwise it returns {-1,-1}.

## 03-2: Addition

Create a function called **Add(int[] m,int[] n)** that adds two matrices *(integer 2d-arrays)* and returns the new 2d-array. Here is how addition works with matrices.


## 03-3: Scalar



## 03-4: Product


## 03-5: Sum of Neighbours
