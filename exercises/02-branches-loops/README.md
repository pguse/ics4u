# Branches and Loops

## Exercises

## 02-0: At Least One Odd Number?
Create a file called **atLeastOneOdd.py**.  Create a program with following specifications:  **Input:**  two integers on the same line separated by spaces, **Output:**  print "YES" if at least one of them is odd and print "NO" otherwise.

### Example Input:
```
  Enter the numbers: 4 7
```
### Expected Output:
```
  YES
```

## 02-1: Ascending Integers?

Create a file called **ascending.py**.  Create a program with the following specifications:  **Input:** three different integers on the same line separated by spaces, **Output:** print YES if they're given in ascending order, print NO otherwise.

### Example Input:
```
  Enter the numbers: 6 10 -46
```
### Expected Output:
```
  NO
```

## 02-2: Multiplication Table  
Write a C# program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table.

### Example Input:
```
  Enter the number: 5
```
### Expected Output:
```
  5 x 1 = 5
  5 x 2 = 10
  5 x 3 = 15
  5 x 4 = 20
  â€¦
  5 x 10 = 50
```
## 02-3: Divisors
Write a C# program that outputs **all the divisors** of a number given as input.

### Example Input:
```
  Enter the number: 12
```
### Expected Output:
```
  1
  2
  3
  4
  6
  12
```
## 02-4: Perfect Numbers
The **divisors** of a **perfect number** ***(except for the number itself)*** add up to the number. For example: 6 has divisors 1, 2, 3, 6 and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. So, 6 is a perfect number. Write a program that determines whether a number is perfect.

### Example Input:
```
  Enter the number: 6
```
### Expected Output:
```
  The number 6 is a perfect number.
```
