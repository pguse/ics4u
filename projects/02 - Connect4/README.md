# Project: Connect 4

This project demonstrates how you might use a **two-dimensional** array in C# to store information in a grid-based game like ***Connect 4*** .  In this case a 6 x 7 two-dimensional array ***(6 rows, 7 columns)*** is used to store the 42 possible positions of the Connect 4 game.  The players of the game indicate which column they would like to play in using the following numbering system.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
