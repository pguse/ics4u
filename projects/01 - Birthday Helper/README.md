# birthday-helper

Write a program to read in names and birth dates from a text file.  It should then 

1. Ask you for a name.  
2. You type in the name, and 
3. It tells you when the person's next birthday will be and,
4. It tells you how old the person will be.  

The input file is given:  **birthdays.csv** . You'll probably want to break each line up and put it in a dictionary, using the name as the *key* and the date as the *value* .
