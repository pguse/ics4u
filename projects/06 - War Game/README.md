# Project:  Card Game - War

## Rules:

* Each player receives 26 cards.
* Each player reveals a card.  The player with the highest card places both cards on the bottom of their deck.  In our code, that means both cards are added to the end of the winner's deck.
* If the cards are equal, then its War!.  In this game, players will deal 3 more cards (not revealed) and turn up another card.  The player with the highest card takes all the cards 'on the table' - in this case 10 cards - and places them at the bottom of their deck.  If War! occurs again, simply keep dealing cards until one player wins both piles. Note:  When War! occurs, the dealt cards should be placed into a List, whose cards are added to the winner's deck and cleared before the next round.
* The game ends when one player runs out of cards.  If a player runs out of cards during war they automatically lose.
