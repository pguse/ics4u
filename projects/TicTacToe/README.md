# Project: Tic-Tac-Toe

This project demonstrates how you might use a **single-dimensional array** in C# to store information in a grid-based game like ***Tic-Tac-Toe*** .  In this case a 9 element array is used to store the 9 possible positions of the tic-tac-toe game.  The players of the game indicate which position they would like to play in using the following numbering system as a guide.
