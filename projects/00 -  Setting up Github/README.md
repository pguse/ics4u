# Setting up Github

1. Install **Git** for [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).  **Git** is a version control system that allows you maintain a history of every version of a file/project as well as collaborate among various team members.
2. Go to github.com and create an account with a username/email that is the same as your Albert College email address.  For example, my account would be pguse@albertcollegess.com.
3. When given a link to an assignment, click the link and then **Accept the Assignment**.  If you are already logged into your Github account you should now see your Tic-Tac-Toe project repository.  It should look something like this.

In order to move the repository onto your own computer, you should go through the next set of steps.

4. Click on the **green button**, in the upper right corner of the current window, labelled **Clone or download**.

5. Copy the link that appears by clicking the copy icon ![](images/CopyButton.PNG)

6. Now open a **terminal/command prompt**.  Navigate to the folder where you are storing all of your computer science work.  You might need to use the **cd** command to move between folders ***(or just open the folder using Visual Studio Code)***.  Once you get to the correct folder, make a ***new folder*** called **GitHub**.
