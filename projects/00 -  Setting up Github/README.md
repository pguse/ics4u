# Setting up Github

1. Install **Git** for [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).  **Git** is a version control system that allows you maintain a history of every version of a file/project as well as collaborate among various team members.
2. Go to github.com and create an account with a username/email that is the same as your Albert College email address.  For example, my account would be pguse@albertcollegess.com.
3. When given a link to an assignment, click the link and then **Accept the Assignment**.
