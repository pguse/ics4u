# Getting Started

# How to Initialize a C# Project

## OPTION 1:

    * In **Visual Studio Code**, create a new folder named **MyProgram** to contain a C# project named **MyProgram**
    * Open a new Terminal.  It should automatically be in the new folder you just created.
    * Type **dotnet new console**
    * This creates a **Program.cs** file in your folder with a simple **"Hello World"** program already written
    * Type **dotnet run** to run the project.

## OPTION 2:

    * Open a new Terminal.
    * Navigate to the folder where you are saving all your C# projects e.g. 12CompSci
    * Type **dotnet new console - o MyProgram** to create a new C# project in the folder named MyProgram
    * Type **cd MyProgram**
    * Type **dotnet run** to run the project.
  


### Note:
When a C# project folder is first opened in **VS Code**, a notification may appear asking if you'd like to add the required assets to build and debug your project.  Select **Yes**

# Output

We will use the **Console.WriteLine()** function or **Console.Write()** to perform text output

# Input

We will use the **Console.ReadLine()** function to get text input, and three variables to store three pieces of information.
